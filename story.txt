Once upon a time there was a boy who dreamed of flying to the moon. One day on his trampoline he jumped so high that he flew to the moon. 
He found the famous footstep by Neil Armstrong. "Wow, I'm on the moon", the boy said, "but now it's time to go home."
Then he jumped back to earth, landed perfectly on his trampoline. Suddenly, he heard his morning alarm. He opened his eyes and said "Oh, It was a dream!"

As soon as he woke up, he went outside to try and recreate his dream. To say the least, it wasn't the moon but the emergency room that he landed in!
